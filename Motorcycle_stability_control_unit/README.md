# Motorcycle Stability Control Unit 
 
## Overview 
Python-based simulation of a motorcycle stability control system that models braking, traction, and lean-angle thresholds for maintaining balance during cornering or emergency braking. 
 
## Features 
- Physics-based model for lean angle, traction, and braking force 
- Adjustable control thresholds for wheel slip and brake modulation 
- Visual simulation for speed vs lean-angle relationship 
- Core logic mimics real-world MSC control behavior
