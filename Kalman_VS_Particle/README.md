# Kalman Filter vs Particle Filter 
 
## Overview 
Comparison of Kalman and Particle Filters for motion prediction and sensor fusion in dynamic environments. Includes simulation, error metrics, and visual analysis in Python. 
 
## Features 
- Implements Kalman and Particle filters from scratch 
- Uses synthetic and recorded motion data 
- Provides RMSE, MAE, and statistical comparison plots 
- Visualizes state estimation and uncertainty regions
